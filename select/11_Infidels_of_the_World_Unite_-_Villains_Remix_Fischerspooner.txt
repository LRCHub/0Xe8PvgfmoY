It's no one's fault but our own
We should have stopped it long ago
If you don't stand for something
You stand for anything
That was what I was told

It's a paranoia
It's a distraction
It's a lack of communication
Fear, fear, fear

Infidels of the world unite
Infidels of the world unite
Infidels of the world unite
Infidels of the world unite

Abandoning
My life is there
Abandoning
My light is there

Why would you want to do it
Doing wrong in the name of right
You're no fool, you're no innocent
Using God to justify your own fight

It's denial
Manipulation
It's an attack on the state of affairs
Fear, fear, fear

Infidels of the world unite
Infidels of the world unite
Infidels of the world unite
Infidels of the world unite

Abandoning
My life is there
Abandoning
My light is there

Infidels of the world unite
Infidels of the world unite
Infidels of the world unite
Infidels of the world unite
